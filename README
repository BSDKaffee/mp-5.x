Minimum Profit (mp) is a text editor for programmers. Among its features
are the following:

 - Fully scriptable using a C-like scripting language.
 - Unlimited undo levels.
 - Complete Unicode support.
 - Multiple files can be edited at the same time and blocks copied
   and pasted among them.
 - Syntax highlighting for many popular languages / file formats: C, C++,
   Perl, Shell Scripts, Ruby, Php, Python, HTML...
 - Creative use of tags: tags created by the external utility _ctags_
   are used to move instantaneously to functions or variables inside
   your current source tree. Tags are visually highlighted (underlined),
   and symbol completion can be triggered to avoid typing your own function
   names over and over.
 - Intelligent help system: pressing F1 over any word of a text being edited
   triggers the underlying system help (calling _man_ when editing C or Shell
   files, _perldoc_ with Perl, _ri_ on Ruby, _winhelp_ on MS Windows...).
 - Understandable interface: drop-down menus, reasonable default key bindings.
 - Configurable keys, menus and colors.
 - Text templates can be easily defined / accessed.
 - Multiplatform: Console/curses, Qt4, GTK+, KDE4, MS Windows.
 - Automatic indentation, word wrapping, internal _grep_, learning /
   repeating functions.
 - Spellchecking support (via the ispell package).
 - Multilingual.
 - Password-protected, encrypted text files (using the ARCFOUR algorithm).
 - It helps you abandon vi, emacs and other six-legged freaks definitely.
