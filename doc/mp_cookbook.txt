Minimum Profit cookbook
=======================

 Angel Ortega <angel@triptico.com>

This document includes some recipes for the Minimum Profit text editor.
These recipes are focused mainly on executing snippets of the Minimum
Profit Scripting Language (MPSL), which is covered in more detail in the
following manuals:

 * ./mpsl_overview.html (Overview). Introduction to the MPSL language.
 * Quick reference as ./mpsl_quickref.txt (text) or ./mpsl_quickref.ps (PostScript).

Other MPSL documentation of interest:

 * ./mpsl_internals.html (Internals). Notes about this particular
   MPSL implementation.
 * ./mpsl_api.html (C API). Reference for using MPSL from inside C programs.

Executing MPSL code
-------------------

There are three ways of executing MPSL inside the editor.

From the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first one is from the command line using the -e switch:

 mp-5 -e 'mp.config.word_wrap = 75;'

This command opens the editor and immediately executes an assignation to
the mp.config.word_wrap variable, giving it a value of 75 (this operation
have activated word wrapping on column 75). Take note that the leading
semicolon is mandatory. Several sentences can be given:

 mp-5 -e 'mp.config.word_wrap = 75; mp.ispell(1); mp.alert("Hello!");'

Word wrapping is set, ispell is activated (if supported) and a greeting
message is given. As seen, any valid MPSL program can be given here.

Using the 'eval' action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'eval' action is on the menu as the "Edit/Execute MPSL code..." entry.
This action asks for a string of MPSL code to be executed. The return
value will be returned as an alert message.

Using the 'eval_doc' action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'eval_doc' in on the menu as the "Edit/Execute document as MPSL". This
action will take the contents of the currently active document and pass it
directly to the MPSL engine.

Using different encodings
-------------------------

By default, MP reads and writes files using the current locale for
character set conversions. This way, if you run it in an UTF-8
environment, you don't have to do anything special, just open and save
your files. But, if you need to read or write files using different
encodings (for example, if your locale encoding is ISO-8859-1 and you need
to read UTF-8 files), you can use the encoding() function. This function
receives an encoding string as argument; after calling it, all I/O
operations will use that encoding. To get back to 'normal' (i.e., default
local encoding), just call it without arguments, or with a NULL one.

This snippet will convert a file named 'text' to UTF-8:

 local d = mp.open('text'); encoding('utf-8'); mp.save(d); mp.close();
