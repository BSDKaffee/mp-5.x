Minimum Profit 5 TODO / Bug List
================================

Release Critical Bugs
---------------------

 * 1102: Tabs are incorrectly coloured when the cursor is over one.
 * 1104: When moving up / down, the X position should match the visual
   column and not the exact one. Now, when moving among lines with a
   different number of tabs, the cursor jumps weirdly.

None!

Pending Enhancements
--------------------

 * 1100: Paren matching should be syntax-highlight-dependent, so that
   HTML / XML / SGML match < > pairs.
 * 1101: Paren matching should not be limited to just parentheses and
   similar, but to full strings (very useful for HTML open / close tags.)
 * 1103: When the end of a coloured block (for example, a comment in
   C code) is lost below the last line, it's not coloured (this probably
   means there should exist 'postread lines')(Fixable with special regular
   expressions; Tue, 15 Nov 2005 13:49:45 +0100).
