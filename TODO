Release Critical Bugs
---------------------

 * 1109: Add jump to matching paren.
 * 1116: Add grep.
 * 1120: Add system command execution (pipes).
 * 1137: Word wrap counts all caracters as measuring 1 column,
   which is stupid. This is specially true for tabs.
 * 1166: Add a file open navigator to TUI.
 * 1168: Port all syntax highlight definitions from mp 3.x.
 * 1169: Port translations from mp 3.x.
 * 1170: The curses driver doesn't redraw when the terminal window
   is resized.
 * 1171: Add interface to set tab size.
 * 1172: Add interface to set the word wrapping column.
 * 1173: Add interface to set the line terminator.
 * 1174: Add interface to set autoindentation.
 * 1175: Add interface to set the tabs-as-spaces.
 * 1176: Add interface to set the undo levels.
 * 1179: It doesn't work with ncurses, so stop lying about it and
   ask for ncursesw.
 * 1183: Many actions should operate only on the selection block
   (expand this bug).
 * 1184: Stop inserting the keypress if a key is not bound.
 * 1194: Underlined text doesn't work under win32.
 * 1195: The curses menu crashes if it doesn't fit on the screen.
 * 1198: Add interface to active spellchecking.

Open Bugs
---------

 * 1150: The GTK menu is not rebuilt when calling mp.update_ui().
 * 1189: mp.drv.form() cannot be used from the command line in win32.
 * 1199: On GTK, the default font (Mono 12, seemingly an alias to an
   actual font) doesn't get its width calculated correctly, so right
   margin detection and mouse positioning doesn't work. To workaround
   this, set mp.config.font_face (in the config file) to an existing
   monospaced font, like "DejaVu Mono" or "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono".
 * 1201: Add selection by mouse dragging to Win32.

Pending Enhancements
--------------------

 * 1100: Paren matching should be syntax-highlight-dependent, so that
   HTML / XML / SGML match < > pairs.
 * 1101: Paren matching should not be limited to just parentheses and
   similar, but to full strings (very useful for HTML open / close tags.)

Closed
------

 * 1103: When the end of a coloured block (for example, a comment in
   C code) is lost below the last line, it's not coloured (this probably
   means there should exist 'postread lines')(Fixable with special regular
   expressions; Tue, 15 Nov 2005 13:49:45 +0100).
 * 1114: Add delete line (Thu, 24 Nov 2005 20:12:05 +0100).
 * 1121: Treatment of EOL in last line is uncertain
   (Thu, 08 Dec 2005 20:01:09 +0100).
 * 1123: When deleting the only line of a file, it gets mad
   (Thu, 08 Dec 2005 20:09:42 +0100).
 * 1104: When moving up / down, the X position should match the visual
   column and not the exact one. Now, when moving among lines with a
   different number of tabs, the cursor jumps weirdly
   (Fri, 09 Dec 2005 10:59:01 +0100).
 * 1105: Use a reasonable build system with config.sh
   (Thu, 15 Dec 2005 08:32:19 +0100).
 * 1124: Add the multi-document management (Thu, 15 Dec 2005 11:12:14 +0100).

   (Thu, 15 Dec 2005 12:09:35 +0100).

 * 1126: The dynamic array length in drw_as_array() is not taken
   into account (Wed, 21 Dec 2005 18:30:22 +0100).
 * 1127: If a double width char does not fit to the end of the line,
   draw a single space instead (Wed, 21 Dec 2005 18:45:08 +0100).
 * 1108: Add word wrapping (Sat, 24 Dec 2005 19:26:45 +0100).

   (Mon, 26 Dec 2005 19:45:20 +0100).
 * 1119: Add learn mode (Fri, 20 Jan 2006 18:55:41 +0100).
 * 1129: Add '+line' command line argument (Tue, 24 Jan 2006 06:22:49 +0100).
 * 1130: When the last open file is closed (so a new, empty file is created
   automatically), the tab files are not rebuilt (as the size of the tab set
   is the same) (Tue, 14 Feb 2006 08:08:55 +0100).
 * 1132: Add move word right (Mon, 20 Feb 2006 17:23:57 +0100).

 * 1134: Add ~/.mp.mpsl (user profile) support (Tue, 28 Feb 2006 17:44:56 +0100).
 * 1135: If ~/.mp.mpsl does not exist, aborts
  (Tue, 11 Apr 2006 17:05:27 +0200).
 * 1117: Add go to line (Mon, 17 Apr 2006 13:36:34 +0200).

   (Wed, 19 Apr 2006 08:16:37 +0200).

   (Thu, 25 May 2006 13:40:26 +0200).
 * 1138: The call to mp.load_tags() in mp_tags.mpsl startup does not
   work because at that time the colors are not built (so there is no
   mp.colors.tag.attr) (Mon, 05 Jun 2006 19:25:32 +0200).
 * 1144: Add the menu (Tue, 06 Jun 2006 19:09:38 +0200).
 * 1146: Add 'recording macro' flag to the status line
   (Sat, 10 Jun 2006 11:51:28 +0200).
 * 1151: The menu should show a ? if the action doesn't exist
   (Tue, 13 Jun 2006 16:19:05 +0200).

   (Tue, 13 Jun 2006 16:19:11 +0200).

 * 1141: Add complete tag support, with 'ctags' execution, asking for
   a tag (needs #1139) and selecting from a list (needs #1140)
   (Thu, 13 Jul 2006 13:59:02 +0200).
 * 1142: Add symbol completion with tags (needs #1140)
   (Thu, 13 Jul 2006 17:10:49 +0200).
